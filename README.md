# Projects

### Surveillance Alert System based on Image Captioning using Deep Learning Approaches  

In the field of **image analytics**, semantic segmentation can determine the objects in an image, but fails to explain the **relationships** between those objects.  
Our project tackled this challenge by developing an **Image Captioning System** using a **CNN–LSTM architecture** and benchmarking it against **GPT-2–generated captions**.

We trained the model on a **Kaggle dataset** of **8,092 Flickr images**, each with 5 descriptive captions.  
To tailor the model for real-world surveillance, we manually curated and added **568 surveillance images** with custom captions.  
The final model could **generate descriptive captions** and **trigger alerts** whenever captions contained *red-flag* words—helping stakeholders respond to critical visual events in real time.
